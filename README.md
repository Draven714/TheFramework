# Mamook
An out-of-date framework that needs to be modernized :)

# About
This framework was created 8+ years ago and has been worked on ever since. It runs several websites but at this time I'll only share one: http://www.michaeldelle.com

There's only two of us working on this framework so it has fallen very behind current standards (routing, composer, autoloading, etc).
